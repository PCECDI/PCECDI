<p align="center">A ( Very ) Small Program for the CDI ðŸ¤£</p>
<p align="center">This little program will help anyone who wants to be able to classify people coming to a college place or organization. It allows you to register based on your last name, first name and class as well as choosing a reason ! I created this program at home, to train for future bigger projects.<br>If you have questions about anything check the official PCECDI wiki : <a href="https://github.com/PCECDI/PCECDI/wiki">https://github.com/PCECDI/PCECDI/wiki</a></p>
