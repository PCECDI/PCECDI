# PCECDI
A ( Very ) Small Program for Student Classification ðŸ¤£ 

I created this program at home, to train for future bigger projects. It is used to classify students coming to the CDI.

## Build from sources

All PCECDI releases are build with Qt Creator. If you want to build your own release you must use it.

## Installing the program

Official releases of PCECDI are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/TheGordonFreeman42/PCECDI/releases/latest). Then extract the zip that you just downloaded and launch the executable !
